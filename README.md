## Usage
Once you have entered the site, if you already made a session you'll have the option to either sign in or login with your email and password. If you have logged in to the site within two hours, you'll be able to immediately access your data because of a token created through the login process and saved in local storage. Once inside the app you'll be able to browse a variety of books and, once you have found one that you like, you can save its ID to array specially linked to your account. In addition you can also view a list of the books within your array and remove any you no longer want.
